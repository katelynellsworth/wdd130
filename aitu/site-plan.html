      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of the website Adventure into the unknown is to help people sign up for a trip. These trips can vary from place to place. The trip right now is to Iceland. The trips come with a guide and security. What is special about our website is the off road traveling we do to experience what only locals know about. This off roading does end up with some extreme sports so make sure you are certified and prepared for the adventure.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        [Here we pride ourselves in giving people great trips they will remember for years to come. The groups are made for 10 people with guides and security. We go away from tourist destinations and see places only locals know about. We provide places to sleep and food to eat during your 3-week trip. Leaving the well-known trail requires some extreme sports to get to where we are going. This includes rock climbing, base jumping, scuba diving and some much more. Certification will be needed in advance before going on the trip as not having the right certification will make you ineligible to participate. We hope to experience our next trip with you!]
