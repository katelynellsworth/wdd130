    <h2>Katelyn Ellsworth</h2>
    <p>Hi my name is Katelyn Ellsworth. I am 26 years old. I am striving for a Bachelors in Applied Technology. I want to become a computer programmer like my father and brother, they are great examples to me. I know this class will help me in my professional life as the main stream job for a computer programmer in on the web.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ all my life but went inactive the last few years. I am grateful for the opportunity to study at a church school like BYU-Idaho. This will help me strengthen my testimony while getting a degree. I have many favorite talks but the most recent talk that helped me was “The reflection in the water by Dieter F. Uchtdorf”.</p>
    <p>I look forward to learning more about computer programming this semester and hope that everyone can progress in this class together.</p>
